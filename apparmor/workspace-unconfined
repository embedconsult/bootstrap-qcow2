# Developer unconfined execution domain
#
# Purpose:
#   Ensure all developer-built executables run unconfined,
#   regardless of Ubuntu AppArmor defaults or future profiles.
#
# This file does NOT grant privileges.
# It only prevents AppArmor mediation for binaries under these paths.
#
# Place ALL developer-built launchers and tools under one of these trees.

# Per-user dev tools
